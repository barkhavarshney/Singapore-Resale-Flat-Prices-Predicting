# Singapore Resale FlatPrices Predicting
Using Data Wrangling, EDA, Model Building, Model Deployment


Introduction: The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly online application to accurately predict the resale values of apartments in Singapore. This predictive model will leverage historical transaction data of resale flats, aiming to provide valuable insights for both prospective buyers and sellers in assessing the market value of a property post-resale. Factors influencing resale prices encompass various aspects such as location, property type, floor area, and lease duration. By furnishing customers with an estimated resale price based on these factors, the predictive model seeks to empower users in making informed decisions amidst the complexities of the real estate market.
